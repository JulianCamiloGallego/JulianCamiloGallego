## Hey there!

## About Me
I'm Julian! I recently finished my studies in Computer Science at the University of Alberta.

Over the past few years, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience through multiple internships, where I contributed to developing full-stack applications for mobile and web platforms. Working at IronSight, I implemented features using C#, Javascript, Flutter, and Vue.js, developing solutions directly shaped by client needs. I’ve collaborated with cross-functional teams and participated in DevOps processes to ensure high-quality, timely project delivery.

I’ve led the development of the Communakit educational platform, tackled UX/UI challenges, and localized applications for multilingual environments. 

I currently live in Edmonton and am eager to apply my skills to impactful projects and continue growing as a developer.
